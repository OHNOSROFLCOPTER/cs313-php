        <h1 class='content_header'>Little About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Senior at BYUI and I'm studying Software Engineering. I'm originally from North Carolina but I've
            lived in Idaho for 7 years so I consider myself an Idahoan. Click on Assignments above to see what I've done in this class so far!</p>
        <p>So far I've really enjoyed my time at the university. I am involved in a lot
            of stuff so you might have seen me around campus. Don't hesitate to come up and talk to me!
            I am always open to learning something new!

        <h1 class='content_header'>Hobbies</h1> 
        <p>I have quite a few hobbies that I really enjoy and they are quite varied. I enjoy playing all sorts of games. However, I'm actually
            semi-competitive in <a href='magicthegathering.com'>Magic: the Gathering!</a> I find it a lot of fun and I 
            participate in weekly tournaments here in Rexburg. I've had a blast meeting all
            sorts of new people playing this hobby and I plan on playing it in the forseeable future.

        <p>I also really enjoy putting together computers! I have quite a few spare parts
            and I think it's fun to put together those parts and hear a new computer roar to life!
            If you ever need to have a desktop put together or need recommendations for parts, I'm your guy!</p>

        <h1 class='content_header'>About Development of this Site</h1>
        <p>This website I did to help me learn a couple things. Not only did I learn a little bit of php doing
            this, but I decided to try out bootstrap as well! I'm still quite unfamiliar with it but making this
            site has certainly allowed me to branch out and understand it. I try new things all of the time and
            bootstrap seems to be pretty cool!</p> 
        <p>I have a wide variety of tools that enable me to not only make this site, but also to make all of my
            projects. I use <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>Visual Studio Code</a> as my goto text editor. I use it as I really like the extendability of it. It
            has a lot of features that I throughly enjoy using it. Who knew that text editors could be so powerful?
            I also do all of my projects on a computer running an Operating System called Manjaro. Manjaro is based
            off Arch Linux, but it's much easier to install. If you are interested in running Linux, I heartily
            recommend <a href='manjaro.org'>Manjaro</a> as it's both lightweight and incredibily useful.</p>
